# Final Report

## Discussion
Our final project ended up being a little different than what we originally proposed. We have not implemented a way to recommend users recipes/foods based on their current macronutrients, opting first to create the CRUD functionalities of the Recipe table and MealPlan tables. The basic calorie counting based on the recipes is still present, as is the visualization, which changed from showing a week's worth of data to only three days for simplicity. 

Usefulness-wise, we have implemented three of the main functions of our app: creating recipes, updating them, and the visualization. In our application, we failed to implement the individual calorie requirement as well as the food/recipe recommendation based on macronutrients.
