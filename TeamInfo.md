## Project Summary
Our project, BalanceBites, is a home for calorie counters who also want to track their nutrients with a little guidance. Our app is designed to make tracking calories and macronutrients (fats, carbohydrates, protein) easy while giving the user recommendations based on their deficiencies in said categories. If a user were lower in fats than proteins, we would recommend them to eat an item with a higher fat content, while if they had almost all their macronutrients, we would then focus on getting their calories up to their chosen level. Our app aims to gather nutritional information from common household foods and recipes, and give the user the choice of what to pick based on the recommended daily values of macronutrients. In this way, our app saves the user time in choosing the most balanced meal or food for their current calorie and macronutrient intake, helping them track their calories and macronutrients while also balancing their diet without the need for lengthy research.
